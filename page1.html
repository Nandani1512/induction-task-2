    <h3> 1. Taj Mahal</h3>
    <div class="content1" >
    <img class="taj" src="tajmahal.jpg" height="200px" width="300px">
    <p>Near the gardens of the Taj Mahal stands the important 16th-century
         Mughal monument known as the Red Fort of Agra. This powerful fortress 
         of red sandstone encompasses, within its 2.5-km-long enclosure walls,
          the imperial city of the Mughal rulers. It comprises many fairy-tale
           palaces, such as the Jahangir Palace and the Khas Mahal, built by
            Shah Jahan; audience halls, such as the Diwan-i-Khas; and two very
         beautiful mosques.</p>

    <h3> 2.Ajanta Cave</h3>
    <div class="content2" >
    <img class="ajanta" src="ajantacave.jpg" height="200px" width="300px">
    <p>The first Buddhist cave monuments at Ajanta date from the 2nd and 1st 
                centuries B.C. During the Gupta period (5th and 6th centuries A.D.), 
                many more richly decorated caves were added to the original group. 
                The paintings and sculptures of Ajanta, considered masterpieces of 
                Buddhist religious art, have had a considerable artistic influence.</p>

 <h3> 3. Sun Temple</h3>

 <img class="sun" src="./konark.jpg" height="200px" width="300px">
 <p>On the shores of the Bay of Bengal, bathed in the rays of the rising sun,
 the temple at Konarak is a monumental representation of the sun god Surya's 
     chariot; its 24 wheels are decorated with symbolic designs and it is led by
      a team of six horses. Built in the 13th century, it is one of India's most 
     famous Brahman sanctuaries.</p>

         <img class="jantar" src="./jantarmantar.jpg" height="200px" width="300px">
         <p>The Jantar Mantar, in Jaipur, is an astronomical observation site built in the early 18th century.
            It includes a set of some 20 main fixed instruments. They are monumental 
                examples in masonry of known instruments but which in many cases have
                specific characteristics of their own. Designed for the observation of
                astronomical positions with the naked eye, they embody several 
                architectural and instrumental innovations. This is the most significant,
                 most comprehensive, and the best preserved of India's historic 
                 observatories. It is an expression of the astronomical skills 
                and cosmological concepts of the court of a scholarly prince at
                  the end of the Mughal period.</p>

          <img class="sikri" src="sikri.jpg" height="200px" width="300px">
             <p>Built during the second half of the 16th century by the Emperor Akbar, Fatehpur Sikri (the City of Victory) was the capital of the Mughal Empire for only some 10 years. The complex of monuments and temples, all in a uniform architectural style, includes one of the largest mosques in India, the Jama Masjid.</p>

              <h3> 6. Ellora Cave</h3>
             <div class="content6" >
              <img class="ellora" src="ellora.jpg" height="200px" width="300px">
                 <p>These 34 monasteries and temples, extending over more than 2 km, were dug side by side in the wall of a high basalt cliff, not far from Aurangabad, in Maharashtra. Ellora, with its uninterrupted sequence of monuments dating from A.D. 600 to 1000, brings the civilization of ancient India to life. Not only is the Ellora complex a unique artistic creation and a technological exploit but, with its sanctuaries devoted to Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, it illustrates the spirit of tolerance that was characteristic of ancient India.</p>
